## Other Examples 

Currently the National Microbiome Data Collaborative 


## Set up 

linkml's recommendation's on creating a new LinkML project details can be found here, <https://github.com/linkml/linkml-project-cookiecutter/blob/main/README.md>

### Setting up poetry and cruft   

#### pipx
Recommendation is to use [pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/) to install poetry and cruft 

##### macos  

```{bash, eval = F}
brew install pipx
```

##### ubutnu  
```{bash, eval = F}
sudo apt update
sudo apt install pipx
pipx ensurepath
```

#### poetry  


```{bash, eval = F}
pipx install poetry

```

Add `poetry-dynamic-versioning` as a plugin

```{bash, eval = F}
poetry self add "poetry-dynamic-versioning[plugin]"
```

#### cruft 

```{bash, eval = F}
pipx install cruft 
```

### Initial set up of cookiecutter LinkML project  

<https://github.com/linkml/linkml-project-cookiecutter/blob/main/README.md#step-3--use-cruft-to-create-your-brand-new-linkml-project>

```{bash, eval = F}
cruft create https://github.com/linkml/linkml-project-cookiecutter

```

![](linkml-project-cookiecutter_answers.png)


```{bash, eval = F}
cd portable-microhaplotype-object
make setup 
# setup is done once 
```

after updating scheme do 
```{bash, eval = F}
make all 
```


Create completely empty github repo named portable-microhaplotype-object 

Set up origin to this repo 
```{bash, eval = F}

git remote add origin git@github.com:PlasmoGenEpi/portable-microhaplotype-object.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

```


Configure your repository for deploying the documentation as GitHub pages

*  Under Settings > Actions > General in section "Workflow Permissions" mark "Read repository and packages permission".  
    *  Under Pages in section "Build and Deployment":  
    *  Under "Source" select "Deploy from a branch"  
    *  Under "Branch" select "gh-pages" and "/ (root)"  


# Keeping your project up to date


Will report if the project is up to date with the coookie cutter 
```{bash, eval = F}
cruft check

```

update the project if the check indicates to do so 
```{bash, eval = F}
cruft upate 
```
