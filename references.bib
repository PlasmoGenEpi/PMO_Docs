  abstract     = {BACKGROUND: Targeted next-generation sequencing offers the
                  potential for consistent, deep coverage of information-rich
                  genomic regions to characterize polyclonal Plasmodium
                  falciparum infections. However, methods to identify and
                  sequence these genomic regions are currently limited. METHODS:
                  A bioinformatic pipeline and multiplex methods were developed
                  to identify and simultaneously sequence 100 targets and
                  applied to dried blood spot (DBS) controls and field isolates
                  from Mozambique. For comparison, whole-genome sequencing data
                  were generated for the same controls. RESULTS: Using publicly
                  available genomes, 4465 high-diversity genomic regions suited
                  for targeted sequencing were identified, representing the P.
                  falciparum heterozygome. For this study, 93 microhaplotypes
                  with high diversity (median expected heterozygosity = 0.7)
                  were selected along with 7 drug resistance loci. The
                  sequencing method achieved very high coverage (median 99\%),
                  specificity (99.8\%), and sensitivity (90\% for haplotypes
                  with 5\% within sample frequency in dried blood spots with 100
                  parasites/µL). In silico analyses revealed that
                  microhaplotypes provided much higher resolution to
                  discriminate related from unrelated polyclonal infections than
                  biallelic single-nucleotide polymorphism barcodes.
                  CONCLUSIONS: The bioinformatic and laboratory methods outlined
                  here provide a flexible tool for efficient, low-cost,
                  high-throughput interrogation of the P. falciparum genome, and
                  can be tailored to simultaneously address multiple questions
                  of interest in various epidemiological settings.},

               collection and processing metadata are well established, the
               lack of common bioinformatic processing metadata has hindered

              AmpSeq data from infectious microbes can inform disease control
              in multiple ways, such as by measuring drug resistance marker
              prevalence, distinguishing imported from local cases, and

              Plasmodium falciparum malaria parasites: a four-locus panel
              (``4CAST'') composed of highly diverse antigens, and a 129-locus
              panel (``AMPLseq'') composed of drug resistance markers, highly
              diverse loci for inferring relatedness, and a locus to detect
              Plasmodium vivax co-infection. We explore the performance of each
              panel in various public health use cases with in silico

  abstract = "Background: National Malaria Control Programmes (NMCPs) currently
              make limited use of parasite genetic data. We have developed
              GenRe-Mekong, a platform for genetic surveillance of malaria in
              the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) that enables NMCPs to
              implement large-scale surveillance projects by integrating simple
              sample collection procedures in routine public health procedures.
              Methods: Samples from symptomatic patients are processed by
              SpotMalaria, a high-throughput system that produces a
              comprehensive set of genotypes comprising several drug resistance
              markers, species markers and a genomic barcode. GenRe-Mekong
              delivers Genetic Report Cards, a compendium of genotypes and
              phenotype predictions used to map prevalence of resistance to
              multiple drugs. Results: GenRe-Mekong has worked with NMCPs and
              research projects in eight countries, processing 9623 samples
              from clinical cases. Monitoring resistance markers has been
              valuable for tracking the rapid spread of parasites resistant to
              the dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine combination therapy. In
              Vietnam and Laos, GenRe-Mekong data have provided novel knowledge
              about the spread of these resistant strains into previously
              unaffected provinces, informing decision-making by NMCPs.
              Conclusions: GenRe-Mekong provides detailed knowledge about drug
              resistance at a local level, and facilitates data sharing at a
              regional level, enabling cross-border resistance monitoring and
              providing the public health community with valuable insights. The
              project provides a rich open data resource to benefit the entire
              malaria community. Funding: The GenRe-Mekong project is funded by
              the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (OPP11188166, OPP1204268).

  abstract     = {Targeted amplicon sequencing is a powerful and efficient tool
                  for interrogating the Plasmodium falciparum genome, generating
                  actionable data from infections to complement traditional
                  malaria epidemiology. For maximum impact, genomic tools should
                  be multi-purpose, robust, sensitive, and reproducible. We
                  developed, characterized, and implemented MAD4HatTeR, an
                  amplicon sequencing panel based on Multiplex Amplicons for
                  Drug, Diagnostic, Diversity, and Differentiation Haplotypes
                  using Targeted Resequencing, along with a bioinformatic
                  pipeline for data analysis. Additionally, we introduce an
                  analytical approach to detect gene duplications and deletions
                  from amplicon sequencing data. Laboratory control and field
                  samples were used to demonstrate the panel's high sensitivity
                  and robustness. MAD4HatTeR targets 165 highly diverse loci,
                  focusing on multiallelic microhaplotypes, key markers for drug
                  and diagnostic resistance (including duplications and
                  deletions), and CSP and potential vaccine targets. The panel
                  can also detect non-falciparum Plasmodium species. MAD4HatTeR
                  successfully generated data from low-parasite-density dried
                  blood spot and mosquito midgut samples and detected minor
                  alleles at within-sample allele frequencies as low as 1\% with
                  high specificity in high-parasite-density dried blood spot
                  samples. Gene deletions and duplications were reliably
                  detected in mono- and polyclonal controls. Data generated by
                  MAD4HatTeR were highly reproducible across multiple
                  laboratories. The successful implementation of MAD4HatTeR in
                  five laboratories, including three in malaria-endemic African
                  countries, showcases its feasibility and reproducibility in
                  diverse settings. MAD4HatTeR is thus a powerful tool for
                  research and a robust resource for malaria public health

  abstract     = {Background: Resistance to antimalarial drugs remains a major
                  obstacle to malaria elimination. Multiplexed, targeted
                  amplicon sequencing is being adopted for surveilling
                  resistance and dissecting the genetics of complex malaria
                  infections. Moreover, genotyping of parasites and detection of
                  molecular markers drug resistance in resource-limited regions
                  requires open-source protocols for processing samples, using
                  accessible reagents, and rapid methods for processing numerous
                  samples including pooled sequencing. Methods: Plasmodium
                  falciparum Streamlined Multiplex Antimalarial Resistance and
                  Relatedness Testing (Pf-SMARRT) is a PCR-based amplicon panel
                  consisting of 15 amplicons targeting antimalarial resistance
                  mutations and 9 amplicons targeting hypervariable regions.
                  This assay uses oligonucleotide primers in two pools and a
                  non-proprietary library and barcoding approach. Results: We
                  evaluated Pf-SMARRT using control mocked dried blood spots
                  (DBS) at varying levels of parasitemia and a mixture of 3D7
                  and Dd2 strains at known frequencies, showing the ability to
                  genotype at low parasite density and recall within-sample
                  allele frequencies. We then piloted Pf-SMARRT to genotype 100
                  parasite isolates collected from uncomplicated malaria cases
                  at three health facilities in Dschang, Western Cameroon.
                  Antimalarial resistance genotyping showed high levels of
                  sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance mutations, including 31\%
                  prevalence of the DHPS A613S mutation. No K13 candidate or
                  validated artemisinin partial resistance mutations were
                  detected, but one low-level non-synonymous change was
                  observed. Pf-SMARRT's hypervariable targets, used to assess
                  complexity of infections and parasite diversity and
                  relatedness, showed similar levels and patterns compared to
                  molecular inversion probe (MIP) sequencing. While there was
                  strong concordance of antimalarial resistance mutations
                  between individual samples and pools, low-frequency variants
                  in the pooled samples were often missed. Conclusion: Overall,
                  Pf-SMARRT is a robust tool for assessing parasite relatedness
                  and antimalarial drug resistance markers from both individual
                  and pooled samples. Control samples support that accurate
                  genotyping as low as 1 parasite per microliter is routinely
                  possible.},
