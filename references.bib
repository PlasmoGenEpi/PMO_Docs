  abstract     = {BACKGROUND: Targeted next-generation sequencing offers the
                  potential for consistent, deep coverage of information-rich
                  genomic regions to characterize polyclonal Plasmodium
                  falciparum infections. However, methods to identify and
                  sequence these genomic regions are currently limited. METHODS:
                  A bioinformatic pipeline and multiplex methods were developed
                  to identify and simultaneously sequence 100 targets and
                  applied to dried blood spot (DBS) controls and field isolates
                  from Mozambique. For comparison, whole-genome sequencing data
                  were generated for the same controls. RESULTS: Using publicly
                  available genomes, 4465 high-diversity genomic regions suited
                  for targeted sequencing were identified, representing the P.
                  falciparum heterozygome. For this study, 93 microhaplotypes
                  with high diversity (median expected heterozygosity = 0.7)
                  were selected along with 7 drug resistance loci. The
                  sequencing method achieved very high coverage (median 99\%),
                  specificity (99.8\%), and sensitivity (90\% for haplotypes
                  with 5\% within sample frequency in dried blood spots with 100
                  parasites/ÂµL). In silico analyses revealed that
                  microhaplotypes provided much higher resolution to
                  discriminate related from unrelated polyclonal infections than
                  biallelic single-nucleotide polymorphism barcodes.
                  CONCLUSIONS: The bioinformatic and laboratory methods outlined
                  here provide a flexible tool for efficient, low-cost,
                  high-throughput interrogation of the P. falciparum genome, and
                  can be tailored to simultaneously address multiple questions
                  of interest in various epidemiological settings.},

               repositories and efforts such as MIxS for common sample
               collection and processing metadata are well established, the
               lack of common bioinformatic processing metadata has hindered
               the ability to do large-scale metaanalyses and the potential for
               data re-use by non-experts such as ecosystem, watershed, or
               earth system modelers. To address this need for Department of

               format which captures both sample preparation and bioinformatic
               processing metadata and stores processed amplicon data as a
               paired abundance table and sequencing file to maximize the
               potential for re-use of these data. To aid in the adoption of
               accessible and reproducible analysis workflows, this reporting
