  abstract     = {BACKGROUND: Targeted next-generation sequencing offers the
                  potential for consistent, deep coverage of information-rich
                  genomic regions to characterize polyclonal Plasmodium
                  falciparum infections. However, methods to identify and
                  sequence these genomic regions are currently limited. METHODS:
                  A bioinformatic pipeline and multiplex methods were developed
                  to identify and simultaneously sequence 100 targets and
                  applied to dried blood spot (DBS) controls and field isolates
                  from Mozambique. For comparison, whole-genome sequencing data
                  were generated for the same controls. RESULTS: Using publicly
                  available genomes, 4465 high-diversity genomic regions suited
                  for targeted sequencing were identified, representing the P.
                  falciparum heterozygome. For this study, 93 microhaplotypes
                  with high diversity (median expected heterozygosity = 0.7)
                  were selected along with 7 drug resistance loci. The
                  sequencing method achieved very high coverage (median 99\%),
                  specificity (99.8\%), and sensitivity (90\% for haplotypes
                  with 5\% within sample frequency in dried blood spots with 100
                  parasites/ÂµL). In silico analyses revealed that
                  microhaplotypes provided much higher resolution to
                  discriminate related from unrelated polyclonal infections than
                  biallelic single-nucleotide polymorphism barcodes.
                  CONCLUSIONS: The bioinformatic and laboratory methods outlined
                  here provide a flexible tool for efficient, low-cost,
                  high-throughput interrogation of the P. falciparum genome, and
                  can be tailored to simultaneously address multiple questions
                  of interest in various epidemiological settings.},
